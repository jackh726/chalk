        // further pending strands (this is a "green cut", in
        // Prolog parlance).

        // This optimization is *crucial* for performance: for
        // example, `projection_from_env_slow` fails miserably without
        // it. The reason is that we wind up (thanks to implied bounds)

        // ```ignore
        // forall<T> { (<T as SliceExt>::Item: Clone) :- WF(T: SliceExt) }
        // ```

        // table goal `!1: Clone :- <?0 as SliceExt>::Item = !1,
        // WF(?0: SliceExt)`.  This causes us to **enumerate all types
        // `?0` that where `Slice<?0>` normalizes to `!1` -- this is
        // an infinite set of types, effectively. Interestingly,
        // though, we only need one and we are done, because (if you
        // look) our goal (`!1: Clone`) doesn't have any output
        // parameters.
        //
        // This is actually a kind of general case. Due to Rust's rule
        // about constrained impl type parameters, generally speaking
        // when we have some free inference variable (like `?0`)
        // within our clause, it must appear in the head of the
        // clause. This means that the values we create for it will
        // propagate up to the caller, and they will quickly surmise
        // that there is ambiguity and stop requesting more answers.
        // Indeed, the only exception to this rule about constrained
        // type parameters if with associated type projections, as in
        // the case above!
        //
        // (Actually, because of the trivial answer cut off rule, we
        // never even get to the point of asking the query above in
        // `projection_from_env_slow`.)
        //
        // However, there is one fly in the ointment: answers include
        // region constraints, and you might imagine that we could
        // find future answers that are also trivial but with distinct
        // sets of region constraints. **For this reason, we only
        // apply this green cut rule if the set of generated
        // constraints is empty.**
        //
        // The limitation on region constraints is quite a drag! We
        // can probably do better, though: for example, coherence
        // guarantees that, for any given set of types, only a single
        // impl ought to be applicable, and that impl can only impose
        // one set of region constraints. However, it's not quite that
        // simple, thanks to specialization as well as the possibility
        // of proving things from the environment (though the latter

        // false conclusions, because e.g. given a program like

        // has failed before we can continue.)
        //
        // In the RR paper, this is acceptable because they assume all

        // (all free variables in negative literals occur in positive

        // could instead generate an (imprecise) result). As you can
        // see a bit later, we also diverge in some other aspects that

        // for positive/negative literals. However, there are some complications
        // that arise that I do not wish to deal with right now.
        //
        // Let's work through an example to show you what I
        // mean. Imagine we have this (negative) selected literal;
        // hence `selected_subgoal` will just be the inner part:
        //
        //     // not { Vec<Vec<Vec<Vec<i32>>>>: Sized }
        //     //       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        //
        // (In this case, the `inverted_subgoal` would be the same,
        // since there are no free universal variables.)
        //
        // If truncation **doesn't apply**, we would go and lookup the
        // table for the selected goal (`Vec<Vec<..>>: Sized`) and see
        // whether it has any answers. If it does, and they are
        // definite, then this negative literal is false. We don't
        // really care even how many answers there are and so forth
        // (if the goal is ground, as in this case, there can be at
        // most one definite answer, but if there are universals, then
        // the inverted goal would have variables; even so, a single
        // definite answer suffices to show that the `not { .. }` goal
        // is false).
        //
        // Truncation muddies the water, because the table may
        // generate answers that are not relevant to our original,
        // untruncated literal.  Suppose that we truncate the selected
        // goal to:
        //
        //     // Vec<Vec<T>: Sized
        //
        // Clearly this table will have some solutions that don't
        // apply to us.  e.g., `Vec<Vec<u32>>: Sized` is a solution to
        // this table, but that doesn't imply that `not {
        // Vec<Vec<Vec<..>>>: Sized }` is false.
        //
        // This can be made to work -- we carry along the original
        // selected goal when we establish links between tables, and
        // we could use that to screen the resulting answers. (There
