# chalk

A [Prolog-ish][Prolog] interpreter written in Rust, intended perhaps for use in
the compiler, but also for experimentation.

See the [Chalk book](https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/book/) for more information.

## FAQ

**How does chalk relate to rustc?** The plan is to have rustc use the
`chalk-solve` crate (in this repo) to answer questions about Rust programs, for
example, "Does `Vec<u32>` implement `Debug`?". Internally, chalk converts
Rust-specific information into logic and uses a logic engine to find the answer
to the original query. For more details, see
[this explanation in the chalk book][chalk-lowering-details].

**Where does the name come from?** `chalk` is named after [Chalkidiki], the area where [Aristotle] was
born. Since Prolog is a logic programming language, this seemed a
suitable reference.

## REPL

There is a repl mainly for debugging purposes which can be run by `cargo run`. Some basic examples are in [libstd.chalk](libstd.chalk):
```bash
$ cargo run
?- load libstd.chalk
?- Vec<Box<i32>>: Clone
Unique; substitution [], lifetime constraints []
```
